## Inspiration
Now more than ever, there is a need for stronger patient relationships and more efficient lines of communication between patients and caregivers. We wanted to improve the health care experience, especially inpatient care, for both patients and caregivers. 

## What it does
Provides a centralized application that displays key hospital-wide metrics and information about patients to increase operating efficiency and improve caregiver-patient relationships. 

## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS to build out the website and Python and SQL for data collection and visualization. We used Github Pages to host the website at the following URL: [link](https://ryanschuerkamp.github.io/HackDavis2021/dashboard.html)

## Challenges we ran into
Trying to get front-end and back-end to interact with one another was difficult. Creating hypothetical data was also a bit challenging, especially simulating true values for patient value. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Deploying the website and how polished it looks. Learning more about HTML and CSS. 

## What we learned
We learned how to deploy a website using Github Pages, how to work with HTML and CSS, and how to apply Python data science skills to work on a real-world problem. 

## What's next for Personalized Hospital Dashboard
In the future, we want a centralized database and make the dashboards interactive and update in real-time. Interact with the Internet of Things to monitor patient vitals, potentially opening the door to immediate patient care made possible through emerging technologies.
